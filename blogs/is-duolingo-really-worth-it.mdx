If you want a quick answer: **No, it’s not worth it.**  
But why? Well, before I explain, let me take you through my journey of learning English.

## 🚀 How It Started

It all started in **August 2022**, when I thought:  
> I should learn English — it’s an important language around the world.

So I went to the Play Store, searched for a language learning app, and voilà — I found **Duolingo**.

## 🔄 My On-and-Off Relationship with Duolingo

At first, I just dove in. I did speaking, reading, writing, and listening every day. But after a few weeks...

😬 I got too shy to do the speaking exercises (people were around me),  
so I deleted the app.

A few months later, I reinstalled it again. This time, I found a feature I loved:  
📘 **Duolingo Stories** — they helped a lot with reading and listening.  
But yep… I eventually got bored again and uninstalled it.

## ✨ The Good Parts

Later, my teacher told me how important English is for programmers —  
especially for reading documentation.

He gave simple advice:
> “Set your phone to English — it helps!”

(I had already done that 😁)

So, I reinstalled Duolingo again. But now, I didn’t pressure myself to grind lessons.  
I just kept a **daily streak** and stayed consistent — even if I only did one small practice per day.

## ❌ Why I Think It’s Not Worth It (Free Plan)

After using Duolingo for **2 years**, here’s my honest take (especially on the free plan):

- 🧠 It only teaches **basic grammar and sentences**
- 🗣️ **Speaking exercises** are locked behind **premium**
- 📉 You get **repetitive content** — which can get boring
- 🧩 Sometimes you learn new words, but… I forget them often 😅

So, is it *completely useless*?  
**No.** It helps you build a habit. But it’s not enough on its own.

## 💬 My Real Learning Methods

Here’s what really improved my English:

- 🎥 **Watching English YouTube videos**  
- 🎧 **Listening to native speakers**  
- 📖 **Free English courses on YouTube**  
- 🧠 **Talking to myself in my head in English**  
- ✍️ **Writing blogs — like this one!** 😄

Duolingo is *one* tool. But if you rely only on it — you won’t improve much.  
You need other ways to practice, and you have to find what works best for **you**.

## 💡 Final Advice

If you want to learn a language:

- Don’t stress yourself trying to be perfect  
- Be consistent — that’s more important than doing it hard  
- Mix tools like Duolingo with real-world input and output

👉 My English is still bad, but I’m improving every day — and that’s what matters.  
🌍 I also enjoy the idea of learning other languages like **Japanese** or **Spanish**,  
but honestly... I don’t even know where to start — hehe 😅

Thanks for reading! 🙏  
Whether you’re just starting or already deep in your language journey, remember:

> **Stay curious, stay consistent, and make it fun!**
