## ⏰ The Illusion of Not Having Enough Time

We’ve all said it:  
> “I don’t have enough time.”

Whether it’s finishing a task, coding a feature, or studying something — it’s easy to blame **time**.

But most of the time… it’s not about time.  
It’s about **focus**.

## ✅ Step 1: Prioritize Your Tasks

I always start by asking myself:  
**What’s the most important thing to do _right now_?**

I usually prioritize based on:
- **Deadlines**
- **Ease of task** (sometimes starting with easy ones helps build momentum)

## 📵 Step 2: Remove Distractions

Your phone, social media, YouTube — they’re enemies of focus.

I place my phone **away from my workspace**, so I’m not tempted to check it.

Out of reach = Out of mind.

## 🎯 Step 3: Set a Clear Target

Don’t just “work.”  
Set a **clear goal** for each session.

For example:
- “Finish this feature.”
- “Write this blog post.”
- “Debug this function.”

Clear goals help you stay focused and motivated.

## ⏲️ Step 4: Use a Timer to Stay on Track

Try the **Pomodoro technique**:
- 25 minutes focus  
- 5 minutes break

This gives structure and helps you avoid burnout while staying productive.

## 🔒 Step 5: Just Focus

At the end of the day, you don’t need more hours.

You just need to **protect your current time** and use it wisely.

Less multitasking. Less distraction.  
**More progress.**
