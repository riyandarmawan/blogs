## 💬 Why I Learned English First

Well, I know I have learned English right now, but that’s just one of my language dreams.

**Why I learned English first?**  
Well, before we dive in, I just want to tell you guys that I’ve been learning English since I was in the 4th grade of my primary school, and I fell in love with it.

As we all know, English is an international language. If you learn English, you can use it all over the world (though not everywhere, like in Indonesia where only a small number of people understand English). Still, English is a global language.

Another reason why I chose to learn English first is because I knew that many language courses available online (which I prefer to learn from) are in English (YouTube, internet, etc.). There are courses in Indonesia with specific languages like Spanish or Japanese, but if you know English, you can study more, as most courses are in English — although still, not *too* many.

Additionally, I love the UK. I love football, and my favorite football team is from there (Manchester City). Also, I really love the British accent (although I haven’t started studying it yet, hehe).

## 🇯🇵 Japanese: A Dream to Study and Experience the Culture

Next up, is Japanese.

Not like most people who love anime and want to learn Japanese because of it, but I want to learn Japanese because Japan is one of my favorite countries. I watch so many things about Japan on YouTube, and I fell in love with the culture, food, and traditions. This made me dream of **studying** and experiencing the country firsthand.

I also have a dream to study in Japan, which would require me to study Japanese. In fact, I’ve already applied for a scholarship to study there.

Actually, I started learning Japanese about a year ago, but then I quit because I made it too hard on myself. I know Hiragana, Katakana, and some Kanji, but since I stopped studying, I’ve slowly started to forget them, hehe.

## 🇪🇸 Spanish: Easy Pronunciation and Cultural Adventure

Now, Spanish.

I love Spanish, and as an Indonesian, I can confirm that Spanish words are quite easy to pronounce. That’s one of the reasons why I want to study Spanish.

I also know that Spanish isn’t just spoken in Spain, but in many countries around the world. So, by learning Spanish, I could travel to beautiful places, taste amazing food, and experience diverse cultures.

## 🤔 Why I Haven’t Started Yet

So, why haven’t I started yet?

Actually, I’ve started learning Japanese, but as mentioned earlier, I made it too difficult on myself, so I quit studying it.

For other languages, I haven’t started yet because, well, as you know, my English is still not perfect. It’s still not great, and I really want to improve my English first.

Another reason is that mastering a language requires consistent practice. The best practice for learning a language is talking to native speakers in their country (but, as you know, I don’t have the money for that — but I hope I can someday). The second best option is practicing with native speakers online using platforms like OmeTV or other language exchange apps, but I’m a little too shy to practice speaking just through my phone, so I haven’t started yet.

## 💭 Final Thoughts

Well, language is one of the most important skills in the world today. If you can master a language, it means you can travel all over the world, learn new cultures, try unique food, and so much more.

For now, I’ll focus on English.  
But someday, I hope I can say **“こんにちは”** and **“¡Hola!”** with confidence too.

Thanks for stopping by, and thank you for being part of this journey! If you're learning a language too, let me know — maybe we can share tips or just support each other. 😊
