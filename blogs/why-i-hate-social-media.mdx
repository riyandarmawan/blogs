Hey there! Today I want to share something a little more personal:  
**Why I really don’t like social media — and why I still haven't quit it completely.**

## 📱 Addicted Without Realizing

At first, I thought social media was totally fine. I used it like everyone else — scrolling, liking, reacting.

But over time, I realized something scary:  
I was addicted.

When I tried to quit one app, I ended up opening another. And the cycle just kept repeating.

## 🔁 The Endless Scroll

Sometimes I’d stick to one platform — but still, I’d scroll for **hours** even when I had important things to do.

It felt like my brain was hijacked.

So yeah, **please don’t try this** — it’s a trap.

## 😞 Comparing Myself With Others

One of the worst parts?  
When I followed my friends, at first it was okay. But then they started posting achievements, or vacation photos...

And I started comparing myself to them 😔

Even though I knew I had my own progress, I couldn’t help but feel **behind**.

## 🎥 This Video Changed My View

Then one day, I saw this YouTube video:  
> 📺 [Menghapus INSTAGRAM selama 30 hari](https://youtu.be/9_s1eyrzWy0?si=khOFsPkXVRSh3fyx) *(in Indonesian)*

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9_s1eyrzWy0" title="Menghapus INSTAGRAM selama 30 hari" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It really hit me. I realized I had **FOMO** (Fear of Missing Out).  
I was afraid of missing updates from one of my friend.

That fear kept me from deleting social media.

## 🧠 My Turning Point

But eventually, I had enough.

I deleted a few of my social media app — and guess what?

- My screen time **went down** (not a lot, but it’s progress).
- I **stopped comparing myself** to others.
- I muted **WhatsApp statuses** too — because honestly, I don’t want to see every update from every contact.

Now, I still use social media — but with **limits**:
- Only in the browser (no apps).
- I log out when I feel addicted.
- I share only what's **important**, not everything.

Social media isn’t 100% bad. But if you can’t control it, it becomes **toxic**.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

I know this post might not relate to everyone. And that’s okay.

But if someday someone finds this and **feels the same way**, I hope it inspires them to take control of their digital life.

Thanks for reading. 🙏  
Take care — and remember: 

>**You’re doing just fine.**
