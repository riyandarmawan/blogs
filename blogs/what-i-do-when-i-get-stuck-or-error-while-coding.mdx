# 🧠 What I Do When I Get Stuck (or Error) While Coding

Hey everyone, today I want to share something all programmers experience:  
**Getting stuck while coding.**

Whether you're a beginner or advanced, getting stuck or facing errors is totally normal. But how you handle it — that’s what matters.

Here’s what I personally do when I get stuck 👇

## 1. 🧩 I Try to Understand the Problem First

The first thing I always do is stop and **think**:  
> _Why is this happening? What exactly is causing the error?_

If I can figure it out on my own, great! But if not, then I move to the next method.

---

## 2. 🤖 I Ask AI for Help

Now that tools like **ChatGPT**, **Gemini**, or **DeepSeek** exist, they’ve become my second go-to option.

Usually, I copy my code, explain the issue clearly, and ask the AI to help me fix it. Most of the time, it works — but not always. If the answer is unclear or not helpful, I don’t waste time. I move on to step 3.

---

## 3. 🌐 I Search on Google (and Stack Overflow)

If AI can’t help me, I go old school:  
> I search the error or bug message on Google.

I usually find helpful answers on:
- Stack Overflow  
- GitHub Issues  
- Developer blogs  
- Reddit, Medium, or Dev.to

These are **real people** sharing their real solutions — and they usually understand the issue better than AI. Actually, before AI was around, this was my first method. It still works great.

---

## 4. 💬 I Ask the Community

If I still can't fix it, I ask **real developers**.

I usually go to:
- Discord programming servers  
- Online forums (like Dev.to or Reddit)

There are many kind developers out there who are willing to help — as long as you ask clearly and show what you’ve already tried.

---

## 5. ☕ I Take a Break

Sometimes, the problem isn’t your code — it’s your brain.

When I feel overwhelmed, I just **take a rest**. Walk away from the screen, do something else, or relax for a while.

Funny thing is, when I come back with a fresh mind:
- I sometimes fix the problem **myself**.
- I can write better prompts to ask AI.
- Or I come up with better **keywords** to search online.

Rest really helps.

## 6. 🛠 Bonus Tip: Plan Your Project

Right now, I’m actually stuck on my own project 😅  
And I realized… it’s because I didn’t plan it well before starting.

That’s why I think:
> Always make a flow or roadmap before building a project.  
> It can really help reduce getting stuck later.

---

## 7. ✍️ Final Thoughts

These are just the methods **I personally use** when I get stuck. But everyone has their own way — and that's okay.

If you don’t have a method yet, feel free to try mine. Or create your own system that works best for you.

Thanks for reading, and good luck with your coding! 💻  
If you're stuck too — don’t worry. You’ll figure it out, one step at a time. ✨
