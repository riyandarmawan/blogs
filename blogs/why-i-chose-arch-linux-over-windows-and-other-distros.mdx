Hey there! If you didn’t know already—yes, **I’m using Arch, btw** 😎  
But not just to flex. This is my honest journey into the world of Linux, and how I eventually landed on Arch.

## 🪟 Starting Out with Windows

Like most people, I began with **Windows 10**. Sometimes, especially on school computers, I used **Windows 11** too. It was all good—until I started doing actual work.

When I was working on some programming projects in **VS Code**, I noticed it was lagging... *a lot*. That's when I began wondering:

> 💭 *Should I switch to Linux?*

## 🧪 My First Linux Experience

Actually, I had tried Linux once before. But the first time I installed it, my screen flickered like crazy, and my keyboard started auto-typing like a ghost was controlling it 👻. I blamed Linux at first—but it turned out to be a hardware issue.

🔧 After changing my keyboard and reinstalling, everything worked. My first real Linux distro?  
**Linux Mint XFCE**.

- First desktop: XFCE — light and fast!
- Switched to: **Cinnamon** — looked great, but a bit laggy.
- Back to: XFCE — smoother, but I started to get bored.

## 🧭 Distro-Hopping Adventures

Curiosity kicked in. I started exploring new distros like a Linux tourist:

- 🧊 **Zorin OS** – clean but heavy.
- ✨ **KDE Neon** – beautiful but laggy.
- 🌲 **Manjaro XFCE** – fast and stable, but... XFCE again?

I was stuck in the “XFCE cycle”—fast but uninspiring.

## 🔲 Discovering Tiling Window Managers

Then I found **Manjaro i3** — a game changer.  
💡 I customized it like crazy and fell in love with the tiling workflow.

Later, I discovered **bspwm** on YouTube and thought:  
> *“That looks cool. Let’s try it!”*

I switched and started customizing it even more. It was lightweight, beautiful, and productive. But I started to feel like **Manjaro had too much bloat** for my taste...

## 🐧 Why Arch Linux?

That’s when I made the move to **pure Arch Linux**. Minimal. Clean. Fast.  
No extra stuff I didn’t need. And with **bspwm**, it felt like *my own OS*.

🛠️ I've been using Arch with bspwm for almost **6 months now**.

It’s not 100% perfect—VS Code still lags sometimes—but I just use **Neovim** instead, and it's all good.

## 💻 Current Setup & Workflow

Here’s a quick look at my current setup:

- **OS**: Arch Linux  
- **Window Manager**: bspwm  
- **Terminal Editor**: Neovim / Vim  
- **IDE (sometimes)**: VS Code (rarely, a bit laggy)  
- **Office Suite**: WPS Office / Microsoft Office (on Windows)  
- **Dual Boot**: Windows 10 (rarely used)

Even though I still dual-boot with Windows, I barely use it—mostly for Microsoft Office. Sometimes I don't even need it because **WPS Office** on Arch does the job.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

So yeah, that’s my journey—from Windows to Linux, through many distros, and finally settling with Arch. ❤️

Not because I want to brag about it—but because:

- It works for me  
- It’s fast and minimal  
- And most importantly, **I love customizing my system**

Thanks for reading 🙏  
And if you’re thinking of trying something new, whether it’s Linux or anything else in life, here’s my advice:

> **Just do it. Step out of your comfort zone. You'll learn more than you ever expected.**
