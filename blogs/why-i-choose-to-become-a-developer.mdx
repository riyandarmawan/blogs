Hey there 👋 I'm Riyan, and this is my first blog post! I want to share the story of how I started my journey to become a developer — from zero experience with computers to building fullstack applications.

### How It All Started

It all began when I didn’t make it through high school in the Natural Sciences track. That was a tough moment, but it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I decided to move to a vocational high school and chose Software Engineering — even though, honestly, I had no idea what software engineers actually do.

At first, it was really hard. I had never even used a computer before. I struggled with basic things — even using backspace was confusing! 😅 It was a little embarrassing, but I didn’t give up. Slowly, I learned how to use a computer, and eventually, I got the hang of it.

### The First Line of Code

Then came coding. I still remember the first program I ever wrote: the classic “Hello World” using Python. It felt so simple — and so powerful. That one little program was the start of everything.

After that, the lessons got harder. I had to build my own programs from scratch. It wasn’t easy, but I pushed through. My knowledge of Python was basic, but it gave me the foundation I needed.

### Falling in Love with the Web

In my second year of school, we started learning about web development — HTML and CSS. And that’s when I fell in love with coding. Creating websites felt like magic.

After about three months, I got the opportunity to intern as a web developer at a startup. Sounds cool, right? But here’s the twist: I had only learned HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Suddenly, I was asked to build a fullstack web application using PHP and CodeIgniter 4 — technologies I hadn’t even touched yet.

The internship lasted three months, and I spent the first half just learning PHP and CodeIgniter from scratch. It was stressful. I kept thinking: what if I can’t finish the app on time? But guess what — I did. I built the application successfully. That experience taught me that I could learn anything if I stayed consistent and curious.

### Learning Beyond School

After the internship, I realized that learning shouldn’t stop at school. I started exploring online resources and teaching myself new technologies — React, Next.js, NestJS, and more. There’s so much available on the internet for free (well, most of it), and it's an amazing way to grow your skills.

If you want to become a developer, don’t rely only on your classes. Learn independently. Build your own projects. Try, fail, and try again. That’s how you grow.

### Final Thoughts

Becoming a developer isn’t easy — but it’s not impossible either. If you want to succeed in this field, keep learning, keep practicing, and never stop building. Tech changes fast, so keep upgrading your skills and stay curious.

Thank you for reading! I’m Riyan, and this is just the beginning of my journey. 🚀
